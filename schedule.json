Tasks requiring higher concentration and energy, such as Python and Mathematics tasks, were scheduled during the pre-committed hours while less demanding tasks related to fitness were planned at those times. However, I also ensured ample rest to help maintain high energy levels throughout your work hours.\n\nThis plan should help you organize your day efficiently, aligning with your energy patterns to improve productivity and help you achieve your goals effectively."
